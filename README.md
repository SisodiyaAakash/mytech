Explanation:

I've utilized the NextJs, Tailwind, and json files with static data in it.
The project is bit challenging for me but I understood the overall data structure and tried my best to normalize the data in a way that it can be fetched in different components around the project.

Also I almost completed two pages Dashboard & Product Listing page, however there are few stuffs are still in progress, I setup the routing for the product & edit page however I've not started with the edit page I've not added any code in the edit directory's page.js file.
I've configured the shadows, fonts and other necessary stuffs for the tailwind.
I've added comment on each commit so you can understand the flow of my overall work.

And from the start I've deployed the project in the vercel as mentioned.

The pending stuffs:
I've not rendered the Top Products and Top Categories yet but it can be fetched from the same json file I used in the product listing page (products.json)
I've not developed the edit page for the product, however I've setup the route to the page and also added it in the CRUD operations of the Product Listing page
There should be number of variations in the product listing page I have not worked yet on that part too.

Thank you Binita & HR Ma'am for this amazing challenging but full of learning opportunity.

Looking forward for the update.

Thanks & Regards,
